git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/codeverse-amol/python-practice.git
git push -u origin main



Remove all files from your GitHub repository in two main ways:

🧭 Method 1: Using Git Commands (from your local machine)
1️⃣ Go to your local repo
cd path/to/your/repository

2️⃣ Remove all files
git rm -r *
This deletes all tracked files from both your local folder and Git tracking.

If you also want to remove hidden files (like .gitignore, etc.):
git rm -r .* --ignore-unmatch

3️⃣ Commit the deletion
git commit -m "Remove all files from repository"

4️⃣ Push the changes to GitHub
git push origin main

✅ This will delete all files from your GitHub repository — the repo will still exist, but it’ll be empty.



🌐 Method 2: Using GitHub Website (directly online)

Go to your repository on GitHub.com
Click on each file or folder you want to delete
Click the trash can 🗑️ icon (top-right corner) → then “Commit changes”
Repeat for each file/folder (tedious for many files)
If you want to delete everything at once, it’s better to use Git commands instead.


⚙️ Optional: If you want to delete only from GitHub, not local

If you want to keep your local files but clear the remote repo:

git rm -r --cached .
git commit -m "Remove all files from GitHub only"
git push origin main


This untracks the files — they remain locally but are removed from GitHub.
